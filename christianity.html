                <b>Underoath's </b>members have identified as Christian in their earlier years and have stated that they are a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explains, "We are Christian but in a different way. We're not like your average Christian band." 
                He explains that Christianity is the "backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles."
                Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their 
                albums are sold in the Christian marketplace.

                Chamberlain said, "I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to be a Christian band that has different beliefs." However, in an interview with 
                Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that " I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'. " Upon releasing their comeback single, "On My Teeth", from Erase Me, the band's first song to feature profanity in their 
                entire career, the band updated their Spotify profile to read "The band who once openly—and without apology—professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me 
                illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems." The band has since openly distanced themselves from Christianity and organized religion. In a 2018 interview, Spencer Chamberlain 
                stated that, "my journey and my role in playing in a Christian band, I held a huge burden and I got burnt really bad and was treated awfully. I'm not saying religion is wrong for everyone, but for me it was wrong. It ruined my life, turned me into a drug addict and people 
                were awful to me the whole time. I never felt more alone in my life than when I was Christian."
