                They have received three Grammy nominations in 2007, 2010 and 2019 respectively and have recorded a live CD/DVD box set entitled Survive, Kaleidoscope, which was released on May 27, 2008. The band then released They're Only Chasing Safety and Define the Great Line,

                Genre
            </h2>
            <p>
                Underoath have been labeled as metalcore, hardcore, post-hardcore, emo and screamo. The band's style has changed over the years, as explained by AllMusic: "since their inception, Florida's Underoath have evolved from a run-of-the-mill Christian 
                metalcore band into a fluid, dynamic, and energized rock group that adeptly blends emotive melody, charged punk rock rhythms, and a chunky, engaging bottom end."and Christian metal. Jesus Freak Hideout also took notice of this, mentioning in a review 
                that "Underoath's sound has evolved a lot - from metal to emocore to straight-up hardcore." As demonstrated on their first release, Act of Depression, Underoath initially played a combination of hardcore and metalcore mixed with black metal and death metal.
                The band kept a similar sound on their second album, Cries of the Past, featuring occasional traces of black metal, but the band later moved away from this style to embrace a more melodic-leaning post-hardcore sound.

            <p>
                On the follow up release, Underoath stood "at the heavy metal crossroads on The Changing of Times, a hardcore album that parallels classic arena rock." The band experimented with electronic elements, with Casey Boland of Alternative Press noting that the album "was an Olympic pole 
                vault-like leap forward for Underoath," and that the band was "welcoming the process of evolution." He also noted the addition of Aaron Gillespie's clean singing, which offered "a compelling counterpoint and presaged a swarm of bands adopting the sing-scream 
                dichotomy that would become the hallmark of 'screamo.'"Cross Rhythms noted the growing popularity of the band, and described them as playing "an interesting mix of hardcore and indie rock, utilising loops, keyboards, acoustic guitars and melodic vocal harmonies, 
                amongst the onslaught of heavy guitars and screeching hardcore vocals." Underoath underwent an extreme overhaul preceding their fourth release, They're Only Chasing Safety, with Dallas Taylor and Octavio Fernandez leaving the band and Spencer Chamberlain taking 
                over lead vocal duties. This marked a radical shift for Underoath, "as the band ditched its formerly metal leanings for the decidedly friendly confines of screamo", a change with ignited a debate over which was better, "old" or "new" Underoath.

                A review by Alex Henderson of AllMusic classifies the album under an alternative rock style which could be described as screamo, post-hardcore, or melodic hardcore, and which differed from full-out metalcore. In another review, Andrew Segal of Cross Rhythms described the album 
                as nu metal, and said that, while on the heavier side of the rock scale, the album is well produced and "shows more signs of intelligence than the [nu-metal] genre is often credited with." For their fifth album, Define the Great Line, Underoath abandoned the pop 
                choruses of the previous album and instead demonstrated a heavier and more eclectic style, updating their sound with "weird" time changes and ambient post-metal passages. According to Sputnikmusic, while the album is basically a modern metalcore recording, it 
                incorporated other influences including post-metal guitar leads on several tracks and ambient electronica on tracks such as "Salmarnir."

            <p>    
                AllMusic stated that the band found the "delicate middle ground between throat-shredding grindcore and My Chemical Romance/From Autumn to Ashes-style 
                emo-punk", and Cross Rhythms described the album as "an impressively versatile project where metal riffs and emo breakdowns, screamo noise and memorable hooks collide in a veritable sonic feast." Underoath's sixth album, Lost in the Sound of Separation, 
                established Spencer Chamberlain as the front-man, and saw the band incorporating some industrial elements. With the departure of the last original member of Underoath, Aaron Gillespie, the band underwent their "biggest shift in sound for the band in a long time."
                On their release, Ø (Disambiguation), Underoath featured a darker and more immersive approach than their previous albums, and used a heavy atmospheric and ambient sound and also utilized groove sections on some tracks. 
                Then on their comeback album, Erase Me, the band presented a more radio rock sound while also sticking with the band's post-hardcore sound with the return of original member Aaron Gillespie on drums taking over clean vocals for the first time since his departure 
                from the band however does share cleans with front man Spencer Chamberlain throughout the record.

            <h2>
                Christianity
            </h2>
            <p>
                Underoath's members have identified as Christian in their earlier years and have stated that they are a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explains, "[We are Christian but] in a different way. We're not like your average Christian band." 
                He explains that Christianity is the "backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles."
                Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their 
                albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                Chamberlain said, "I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to be a Christian band that has different beliefs." However, in an interview with 
                Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that "I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'" Upon releasing their comeback single, "On My Teeth", from Erase Me, the band's first song to feature profanity in their 
                entire career, the band updated their Spotify profile to read "The band who once openly—and without apology—professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me 
                illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems." The band has since openly distanced themselves from Christianity and organized religion. In a 2018 interview, Spencer Chamberlain 
                stated that, "my journey and my role in playing in a Christian band, I held a huge burden and I got burnt really bad and was treated awfully. I'm not saying religion is wrong for everyone, but for me it was wrong. It ruined my life, turned me into a drug addict and people 
                were awful to me the whole time. I never felt more alone in my life than when I was Christian."
