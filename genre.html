        <p>
            <b>Underoath</b> have been labeled as metalcore, hardcore, post-hardcore, emo and screamo. The band's style has changed over the years, as explained by AllMusic: "Since their inception, Florida's Underoath have evolved from a run-of-the-mill Christian 
            metalcore band into a fluid, dynamic, and energized rock group that adeptly blends emotive melody, charged punk rock rhythms, and a chunky, engaging bottom end."and Christian metal. Jesus Freak Hideout also took notice of this, mentioning in a review 
            that "Underoath's sound has evolved a lot - from metal to emocore to straight-up hardcore." As demonstrated on their first release, Act of Depression, Underoath initially played a combination of hardcore and metalcore mixed with black metal and death metal.
            The band kept a similar sound on their second album, Cries of the Past, featuring occasional traces of black metal, but the band later moved away from this style to embrace a more melodic-leaning post-hardcore sound. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On the follow up release, Underoath stood "at the heavy metal crossroads on The Changing of Times, a hardcore album that parallels classic arena rock." The band experimented with electronic elements, with Casey Boland of Alternative Press noting that the album "was an Olympic pole 
            vault-like leap forward for Underoath," and that the band was "welcoming the process of evolution." He also noted the addition of Aaron Gillespie's clean singing, which offered "a compelling counterpoint and presaged a swarm of bands adopting the sing-scream 
            dichotomy that would become the hallmark of 'screamo.'"Cross Rhythms noted the growing popularity of the band, and described them as playing "an interesting mix of hardcore and indie rock, utilising loops, keyboards, acoustic guitars and melodic vocal harmonies, 
            amongst the onslaught of heavy guitars and screeching hardcore vocals." Underoath underwent an extreme overhaul preceding their fourth release, They're Only Chasing Safety, with Dallas Taylor and Octavio Fernandez leaving the band and Spencer Chamberlain taking 
            over lead vocal duties. This marked a radical shift for Underoath, "as the band ditched its formerly metal leanings for the decidedly friendly confines of screamo", a change with ignited a debate over which was better, "old" or "new" Underoath.

            A review by Alex Henderson of AllMusic classifies the album under an alternative rock style which could be described as screamo, post-hardcore, or melodic hardcore, and which differed from full-out metalcore. In another review, Andrew Segal of Cross Rhythms described the album 
            as nu metal, and said that, while on the heavier side of the rock scale, the album is well produced and "shows more signs of intelligence than the [nu-metal] genre is often credited with." For their fifth album, Define the Great Line, Underoath abandoned the pop 
            choruses of the previous album and instead demonstrated a heavier and more eclectic style, updating their sound with "weird" time changes and ambient post-metal passages. According to Sputnikmusic, while the album is basically a modern metalcore recording, it 
            incorporated other influences including post-metal guitar leads on several tracks and ambient electronica on tracks such as "Salmarnir." 
        </p>

            AllMusic stated that the band found the "delicate middle ground between throat-shredding grindcore and My Chemical Romance/From Autumn to Ashes-style 
            emo-punk", and Cross Rhythms described the album as "an impressively versatile project where metal riffs and emo breakdowns, screamo noise and memorable hooks collide in a veritable sonic feast." Underoath's sixth album, Lost in the Sound of Separation, 
            established Spencer Chamberlain as the front-man, and saw the band incorporating some industrial elements. With the departure of the last original member of Underoath, Aaron Gillespie, the band underwent their "biggest shift in sound for the band in a long time."
            On their release, Ø (Disambiguation), Underoath featured a darker and more immersive approach than their previous albums, and used a heavy atmospheric and ambient sound and also utilized groove sections on some tracks. 
            Then on their comeback album, Erase Me, the band presented a more radio rock sound while also sticking with the band's post-hardcore sound with the return of original member Aaron Gillespie on drums taking over clean vocals for the first time since his departure 
            from the band however does share cleans with front man Spencer Chamberlain throughout the record.
